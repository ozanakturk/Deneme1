Hello Soheil.

If you have trouble running the code, you can read this note.

I assume Python and PyQt5 are installed on your computer.
If not, you can download them by using Command Prompt.

You can run the .py file by following the steps below;
- Copy the location of the "plot1" folder
- Open cmd (you can type cmd in search)
- Type "cd " and paste the location of "plot1"
- Type "python plot1" and it should be running as expected

To access the code lines, open "plot1.py" with a text editor/viewer.
I tried to explained the code as much as I could at the beginning. 
Still, you can ask me anything suspicious or unclear.

Greetings
Ozan
